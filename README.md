# Client Loyalty; Sales Behavior vs Harvest Yields


Team Members: Lokendra Singh Badgujar, Srujana Gali, Xingyu Yao, Sarmad Kahut

#### Problem Definition

MyAgro works on improving the financial status of rural populations in Western Africa by providing mobile layaway, input delivery, and agricultural training to ensure better yields. Our goal is to find the relationship between client loyalty and their harvest yields. For example, for clients who were satisfied with the training module in the current season, did they get a high yield in the harvest seasons? If they did, would they buy more products in the next season?
